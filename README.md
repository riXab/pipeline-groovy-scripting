# maven-project
Source code for DevOps Training. Triggering Automatically.
Created project for Pipeline as a Code; Groovy Scripting.
Check using DSL script option in the Job Configuration...
Check Configuration as a Code using groovy script.
Note:
-----
	-- Read somewhere that says not to download groovy plugins since it may affect the jenkins class file from working during Groovy scripting.
		-- Says that Jenkins's JVM itself has groovy classes and its own as well. Like in-built?
		-- So, theoritically, if Groovy plugin is used.. then the Jenkins's class will be blocked.
			- Do a lot of RnD on this shit!
